# Dockerfile for Robot Simulation

This project includes a Dockerfile to containerize the ROS2-based robot simulation. The Dockerfile sets up an environment with ROS2 (e.g., Foxy), necessary dependencies, and the robot simulation code, making it easy to deploy and run the simulation in a consistent and reproducible manner.

## Features

- **Docker Container**: A pre-configured Docker container for running the robot simulation node.
- **ROS2 Setup**: The Dockerfile installs and configures ROS2 (e.g., Foxy) and required dependencies.
- **Simulation Ready**: The container runs the `robot_simulation_node.py` to start the robot simulation.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Dockerfile, make sure you have the following:

1. Install Docker on your system. Follow the official [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Make sure that your system has enough resources (RAM, CPU) to run the simulation in a Docker container.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository with the Dockerfile and the necessary simulation code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Techboy-lab2025/robot_simulation_node.git
cd robot_simulation_node
